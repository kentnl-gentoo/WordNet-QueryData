	* README: make specific to QueryData
	* README: rewrite to correspond to Query
	* test.pl: rename from my_test.pl
	* my_test.pl: add test 12; test long POS names
	* QueryData.pm (get_all_words): fix
	* QueryData.pm: allow long relation names; allow long POS names;
	check for illegal POS

	* my_test.pl: nice test suite for QueryData 1.2.
	* QueryData.pm: first draft of direct access to WordNet data
	files; 'new'ing is slow; about 15 seconds on my PII/400.  Memory
	consumption using WordNet 1.6 is appx. 16M.  Still need to
	integrate forms into query.  query requires the word form to be
	exactly like that in WordNet (although caplitalization may differ)

	* my_test.pl: test corpus for QueryData

	* QueryData.pm: access data files directly; us a more OO style of
	coding; initialization (new) code is pretty much done; forms is
	done
