WordNet::QueryData perl module
------------------------------

WordNet::QueryData provides a direct interface to the WordNet database
files.  It requires the WordNet package
(http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/).  It allows the user direct
access to the full WordNet semantic lexicon.  All parts of speech are
supported and access is generally very efficient because the index and
morphical exclusion tables are loaded at initialization.  This
initialization step is slow (appx. 10-15 seconds), but queries are
very fast thereafter---thousands of queries can be completed every
second.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

- Perl5 (e.g 5.005_03 or 5.6.1)
- WordNet Database Package version 2.0 

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

Make sure to read the included man page ("perldoc QueryData.pm" or
"perldoc WordNet::QueryData" to extract).

The ChangeLog file lists a summary of changes to the code.

See http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wn-perl for information on the mailing list.

BUILD & INSTALL (Unix)
----------------------

See below for Windows install.

Installation uses the perl MakeMaker utility ('perldoc
ExtUtils::MakeMaker').  To build and test the distribution do:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test

If "perl Makefile.PL" breaks or "make test" doesn't work at all ("not
ok 1"), you may not have the WNHOME environment variable defined
correctly.  Read the QueryData manual page ("perldoc QueryData.pm") to
find out how to tell it where your WordNet database is located (you'll
need to edit test.pl).  

If any of the tests fail, send e-mail to the wn-perl mailing list (see
DOCUMENTATION).

If the tests run okay, install with (this may need to be run as root):

     make install


CUSTOM DIRECTORY
----------------

To install WordNet::QueryData in /foo/bar/baz do:

mkdir /foo/bar/baz/WordNet
cp QueryData.pm /foo/bar/baz/WordNet

Make sure to add /foo/bar/baz to perl's @INC variable (e.g. -I/foo/bar/baz)

WINDOWS
-------

  0) Make sure that you have installed WordNet to C:\Program Files\WordNet\2.0
  1) Unpack the WordNet QueryData distribution
  2) Copy QueryData.pm to C:\Program Files\WordNet
  3) Run perl -I"C:\Program Files" test.pl to test the installation
