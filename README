WordNet::QueryData perl module
------------------------------

WordNet::QueryData provides a direct interface to the WordNet database
files.  It requires the WordNet package
(http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/).  It allows the user direct
access to the full WordNet semantic lexicon.  All parts of speech are
supported and access is generally very efficient because the index and
morphical exclusion tables are loaded at initialization.  This
initialization step is slow (appx. 10-15 seconds), but queries are
very fast thereafter---thousands of queries can be completed every
second.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

- Perl5 (e.g 5.005_03 or 5.6.1)
- WordNet Database Package version 1.6, 1.7 or 1.7.1

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

Make sure to read the included man page ("perldoc QueryData.pm" or
"perldoc WordNet::QueryData" to extract).

The ChangeLog file lists a summary of changes to the code.

See http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wn-perl for information on the mailing list.

BUILD & INSTALL (Unix)
----------------------

See below for Windows install.

Installation uses the perl MakeMaker utility ('perldoc
ExtUtils::MakeMaker').  To build and test the distribution do:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test

If "perl Makefile.PL" breaks or "make test" doesn't work at all ("not
ok 1"), you may not have the WNHOME environment variable defined
correctly.  Read the QueryData manual page ("perldoc QueryData.pm") to
find out how to tell it where your WordNet database is located (you'll
need to edit test.pl).  

If any of the tests fail, send e-mail to the wn-perl mailing list (see
DOCUMENTATION).

If the tests run okay, install with (this may need to be run as root):

     make install


CUSTOM DIRECTORY
----------------

To install WordNet::QueryData in /foo/bar/baz do:

mkdir /foo/bar/baz/WordNet
cp QueryData.pm /foo/bar/baz/WordNet

Make sure to add /foo/bar/baz to perl's @INC variable (e.g. -I/foo/bar/baz)

WINDOWS
-------

Here's the install proceedure suggested by Luigi Bianchi, lbianchi AT
yorku.ca, for Win95.  Let me, jrennie AT ai.mit.edu, know if this
doesn't work for other Windows variants.  NOTE: step 3 should no
longer be necessary.

  1) Unpack your distribution anywhere.  I did in  /djgpp/lib/perl5/site.
  2) Create the dir WordNet off the distribution, i.e. 
     /djgpp/lib/perl5/site/WordNet-QueryData-1.10/WordNet  and copy
     QueryData.pm in it.
  3) In the wordNet distribution directory ( /wn16/dict ) rename (or copy,
     if other packages depend on the distribution filenames) all the
     *.idx files index.* and all the *.dat files data.* 
  4) Follow your instructions as per your README, i.e. replace 
     "/usr/local/dict" with "/wn16/dict" in test.pl
  5) Start bash etc. 
  
  I noticed that, despite the final success, perl complains that it can't 
  find perl5 (though in fact it does--just a question of how the version is 
  reported); that MANIFEST and README are missing (though they are there with 
  test.pl), and that blib already exists (it does).
