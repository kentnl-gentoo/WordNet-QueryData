WordNet::QueryData perl module
------------------------------

Provides an object-oriented perl interface to the full WordNet system.
This is my second attempt at a perl interface to WN.  This draft
includes full support for all parts of WordNet (nouns, verbs,
adjectives and adverbs) and is very efficient after the initialization
step (where index and morph. exc. files are loaded).  This
initialization step will prove to be annoying if you simply want to
'play' with WordNet.  On my PIII/500, it takes about 12 seconds and 16
megs of memory to initialize.  After that, however, things should be
blazingly fast and efficient.  All file access is done with fseek
calls and takes full advantage of the static nature of the WordNet
data.* files.

See the man page ('perldoc WordNet::QueryData' after having run
'make') for information on all that is possible.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

Perl5
WordNet 1.6 or 1.7 (http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/obtain/)

Strictly speaking, only the WN 1.6 data files are required (everything
in the 'dict' directory), but you might as well install all of WN 1.6
while you're at it.

BUILD & INSTALL
---------------

To put WordNet::QueryData in the standard place do:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test

Before running 'make test', you will need to modify test.pl to indicate
the correct location of the WordNet 'dict' directory.  The default
location is /usr/local/dict.

To install do:

make install

NOTE: The above has been tested with RedHat Linux and is likely to
work under most unices.  See below for notes on a Windows install.

CUSTOM DIRECTORY
----------------

To install WordNet::QueryData in /foo/bar/baz do:

mkdir /foo/bar/baz/WordNet
cp QueryData.pm /foo/bar/baz/WordNet

Make sure to add /foo/bar/baz to perl's @INC variable (e.g. -I/foo/bar/baz)

WINDOWS
-------

Here's the install proceedure suggested by Luigi Bianchi
<lbianchi@yorku.ca> for Win95.  Let me <jrennie@ai.mit.edu> know if this
doesn't work for other Windows variants.

  1) Unpack your distribution anywhere.  I did in  /djgpp/lib/perl5/site.
  2) Create the dir WordNet off the distribution, i.e. 
     /djgpp/lib/perl5/site/WordNet-QueryData-1.10/WordNet  and copy
     QueryData.pm in it.
  3) In the wordNet distribution directory ( /wn16/dict ) rename (or copy,
     if other packages depend on the distribution filenames) all the
     *.idx files index.* and all the *.dat files data.* 
  4) Follow your instructions as per your README, i.e. replace 
     "/usr/local/dict" with "/wn16/dict" in test.pl
  5) Start bash etc. 
  
  I noticed that, despite the final success, perl complains that it can't 
  find perl5 (though in fact it does--just a question of how the version is 
  reported); that MANIFEST and README are missing (though they are there with 
  test.pl), and that blib already exists (it does).

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

The included man page (do 'perldoc WordNet::QueryData' to extract) should
give you a good idea of how to use this module and what it is good
for.

If you are upgrading from an older version, check the ChangeLog file
for information about changes to the code.
