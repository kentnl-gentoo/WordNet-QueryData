WordNet::QueryData perl module
------------------------------

WordNet::QueryData provides a direct interface to the WordNet database
files.  It requires the WordNet package
(http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/).  It allows the user direct
access to the full WordNet semantic lexicon.  All parts of speech are
supported and access is generally very efficient because the index and
morphical exclusion tables are loaded at initialization.  This
initialization step is slow (appx. 10-15 seconds), but queries are
very fast thereafter---thousands of queries can be completed every
second.

See the man page ('perldoc WordNet::QueryData' after having run
'make') for information on all that is possible.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

Perl5
WordNet "Unix" Database Package version 1.6 or 1.7 (obtain from
  http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/obtain/)

Strictly speaking, only data files are required (everything in the
'dict' directory).

BUILD & INSTALL (Unix)
----------------------

To install WordNet::QueryData to the standard place on a unix-like
system, do:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test

Before running 'make test', you will need to modify test.pl to indicate
the correct location of the WordNet 'dict' directory.  The default
location is /usr/local/dict.

To install do:

make install

CUSTOM DIRECTORY
----------------

To install WordNet::QueryData in /foo/bar/baz do:

mkdir /foo/bar/baz/WordNet
cp QueryData.pm /foo/bar/baz/WordNet

Make sure to add /foo/bar/baz to perl's @INC variable (e.g. -I/foo/bar/baz)

WINDOWS
-------

Here's the install proceedure suggested by Luigi Bianchi
<lbianchi@yorku.ca> for Win95.  Let me <jrennie@ai.mit.edu> know if this
doesn't work for other Windows variants.

  1) Unpack your distribution anywhere.  I did in  /djgpp/lib/perl5/site.
  2) Create the dir WordNet off the distribution, i.e. 
     /djgpp/lib/perl5/site/WordNet-QueryData-1.10/WordNet  and copy
     QueryData.pm in it.
  3) In the wordNet distribution directory ( /wn16/dict ) rename (or copy,
     if other packages depend on the distribution filenames) all the
     *.idx files index.* and all the *.dat files data.* 
  4) Follow your instructions as per your README, i.e. replace 
     "/usr/local/dict" with "/wn16/dict" in test.pl
  5) Start bash etc. 
  
  I noticed that, despite the final success, perl complains that it can't 
  find perl5 (though in fact it does--just a question of how the version is 
  reported); that MANIFEST and README are missing (though they are there with 
  test.pl), and that blib already exists (it does).

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

The included man page (do 'perldoc WordNet::QueryData' to extract) should
give you a good idea of how to use this module and what it is good
for.

If you are upgrading from an older version, check the ChangeLog file
for information about changes to the code.
